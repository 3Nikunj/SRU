# Learning Data Structures and Algorithms with Python

This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python. It serves as a personal log of my progress and a collection of solutions to common problems.

## Repository Structure

The code is organized into directories based on the day of learning:

*   `Day1/`: Introduction to Python and OOP concepts.
*   `Day3/`: Exception handling, file I/O.
*   `Day4/`: Python collections, multithreading, and strings.
*   `Day4project/`: A project demonstrating multithreading by downloading images.
*   `sample/`: Contains sample code and experiments.

## Topics Covered

*   **Object-Oriented Programming:** Abstraction, Encapsulation
*   **Core Python:** Exception Handling, File Handling, Strings, Collections
*   **Concurrency:** Multithreading

## How to Use

Most of the code can be run directly using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python <directory_name>/<file_name>.py
```

Some projects might have their own virtual environments and dependencies. Please check the respective project directories for more details.

## Contributing
